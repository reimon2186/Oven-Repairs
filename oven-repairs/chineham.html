        <strong>Do you offer same-day or next-day oven repairs?</strong>
      </button>
      <p id="faq-1" class="faq-answer">
        Yes we usually can! If we have availability, we offer same-day or next-day appointments. 
        In some cases, we can even complete same-day repairs if we already have the parts needed.
      </p>

      <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq-2">
        <strong>What happens if you don’t have the part for my oven repair?</strong>
      </button>
      <p id="faq-2" class="faq-answer">
        If we don’t have the part in stock, we’ll order it straight away and return to fit it ASAP.
        You won’t be charged for multiple visits. You’ll only ever pay for the service fee and the part itself.
      </p>

      <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq-4">

      </button>
      <p id="faq-4" class="faq-answer">
        No, we currently only repair electric ovens. If you’re unsure what type you have, feel free to call us for advice before booking.
