            <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
            <p>Last Updated: 14/10/2025</p>

            <p>Welcome to Basingstoke Oven Repair!</p>
            <p>
                These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) set out the agreement between you and Basingstoke Oven Repair (“we,” “our,” or “us”) regarding the use of our website and the services we provide. 
                By accessing or using our services, you accept and agree to these Terms. Please read them carefully before making a booking.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Services</h2>
            <p>
                We provide professional oven repair services for domestic customers. All services are subject to technician availability and booking confirmation.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Pricing</h2>
            <p>
                Prices for our repair services are displayed on our website and confirmed at the time of booking. They may vary depending on the type, model, and condition of the oven being repaired.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Bookings and Cancellations</h2>

            <h3>3.1 Booking Confirmation</h3>
            <p>
                A booking is considered confirmed once a date and time have been agreed upon. We reserve the right to reschedule appointments in the event of unforeseen circumstances. In such cases, we will notify you as early as possible.
            </p>

            <h3>3.2 Cancellations</h3>
            <p>
                If you wish to cancel or reschedule your appointment, we ask that you provide at least 24 hours’ notice. Failure to do so may result in a cancellation fee.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Customer Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>
                Customers are responsible for ensuring that our technicians have clear and safe access to the oven and for providing accurate information about the appliance’s condition. 
                If the condition of the oven differs significantly from the information provided, additional charges may apply or the service may be refused.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Liability</h2>
            <p>
                While we take great care in carrying out repairs, we cannot accept responsibility for any pre-existing faults, damage, or wear to your appliance or property. 
                Any issues or concerns regarding the service must be reported to us immediately following completion of the repair.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Payment</h2>
            <p>
                Payment is due upon completion of the repair service unless otherwise agreed in writing. We accept payment by cash, bank transfer, or other methods as specified at the time of booking.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Guarantees and Parts</h2>
            <p>
                Replacement parts installed during repairs are covered by the manufacturer’s warranty, not by Basingstoke Oven Repair directly. 
                We do not offer an independent guarantee on parts or on the repair itself. 
                However, if a problem arises shortly after a service and it is determined to have resulted from our workmanship, we will return to rectify the issue at no additional cost. 
                Any faults caused by unrelated issues or user misuse will not be covered under this provision.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Privacy</h2>
            <p>
                All personal data collected during the booking process or while providing our services will be handled in accordance with our <a href="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to update or modify these Terms from time to time. The most recent version will always be available on our website. 
                Continued use of our services following any updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
            </p>

            <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
            <p>
